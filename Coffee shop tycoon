Explanation:
 * Node2D: This script extends the Node2D class, allowing you to create visual elements and interact with other nodes in your scene.
 * Variables:
   * resources: Stores the amount of coffee beans, milk, and sugar.
   * money: Tracks the amount of money earned.
 * Signals: Signals are used to communicate between different parts of the game (e.g., when coffee is brewed, a customer is served, or a payment is received).
 * Callback Functions: These functions are called when the corresponding signals are emitted.
 * Game Logic: This is where the core game logic will be implemented, such as resource management, customer interactions, and business expansion.
To use this code:
 * Create a new Godot project.
 * Create a new scene and add this script to the root node.
 * Create child nodes for CoffeeMachine, Barista, CashRegister, and CustomerSpawner in the scene.
 * Implement the logic for each of these child nodes in their respective scripts.
 * Create UI elements (e.g., resource bars, buttons) to interact with the game.
This is a very basic example. To create a full-fledged Coffee Shop Tycoon game, you'll need to:
 * Expand on the game logic: Implement more complex resource management, customer interactions, staff management, and business expansion mechanics.
 * Create visual assets: Design sprites for the coffee shop, characters, and UI elements.
 * Implement sound effects: Add sound effects for brewing coffee, customer interactions, and background music.
 * Optimize performance: Optimize the game for smooth gameplay and efficient resource usage.
 * Test and iterate: Playtest the game and make adjustments based on feedback.
Remember that game development is an iterative process. Start with a simple prototype and gradually add more features and complexity as you progress.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or would like to explore specific aspects of the game in more detail.

Explanation:
 * Node Setup:
   * The script extends Node2D, allowing it to be attached to a node in your Godot scene.
   * onready variables connect to the child nodes (CoffeeMachine, Barista, etc.) for easier access.
 * Resources and Money:
   * resources dictionary stores the amounts of coffee beans, milk, and sugar.
   * money variable tracks the current amount of money earned.
 * Signal Connections:
   * connect() establishes connections between signals emitted by child nodes and functions in this script. This allows for communication and updates between different parts of the game.
 * Callback Functions:
   * _on_coffee_brewed(): This function is called when the CoffeeMachine emits the "coffee_brewed" signal. It currently only consumes coffee beans.
   * _on_customer_served(): This function is called when the Barista emits the "customer_served" signal. You'll need to implement logic here to increase customer satisfaction, update game statistics, etc.
   * _on_payment_received(): This function is called when the CashRegister emits the "payment_received" signal. It increases the money variable by the received amount.
   * _on_customer_spawned(): This function is called when the CustomerSpawner emits the "customer_spawned" signal. You'll need to implement logic here to handle customer orders, spawn customers with different preferences, and manage customer queues.
 * Upgrade Coffee Machine:
   * _upgrade_coffee_machine() demonstrates a simple upgrade mechanic. If the player has enough money, the function deducts the cost and increases the coffee machine's brewing speed.
To use this script:
 * Create a new Godot scene.
 * Add a Node2D to the scene and attach this script to it.
 * Create child nodes for CoffeeMachine, Barista, CashRegister, and CustomerSpawner in the scene.
 * Implement the logic for each of these child nodes in their respective scripts.
 * Create UI elements (resource bars, money display, buttons, etc.) and connect them to the game logic.
Important Notes:
 * This is a very basic example. You'll need to add much more functionality to create a complete game.
 * Consider using a state machine to manage different game states (e.g., idle, serving customer, brewing coffee).
 * Implement AI for customers and staff to make the game more dynamic.
 * Add visual feedback for game events (e.g., animations for brewing coffee, customer interactions, etc.).
 * Optimize your code and assets to ensure smooth performance.
Remember to break down the game into smaller, manageable tasks and gradually build upon the core functionality. Good luck with your Coffee Shop Tycoon game!
